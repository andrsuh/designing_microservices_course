# Discovery properties
# Discovery service - is a service which is responsible for handling information about every
# running service (name, URL, and same for all it's nodes), so every service can get information
# about another one only by it's name. We have discovery service called
# eureka-service-discovery (it's a separate app inside this project). This service contains component
# called Eureka-server which does all the magic. All of the other services have to have
# dependency called Eureka-client to be able to register itself in discovery service.
# This property is used by Eureka client (added as a dependency to tariff-management-service)
# to determine location of discovery service for further registration in discovery service.
